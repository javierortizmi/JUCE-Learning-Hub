## How to Build

Each tutorial contains a `.jucer` project file for use with the Projucer, and a `CMakeLists.txt` for building with CMake.

Make sure you have the JUCE submodule initialized:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Build using either:

- **Projucer**: Open the `.jucer` file, save the project, then build with your IDE.
- **CMake**: Run `cmake` and build from the command line or your IDE.
